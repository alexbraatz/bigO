// A typical example, O(n^2), which is usually pronounced "Big O squared"
// The letter "n" represents the input size, and the function "g(n) = n^2"
// inside the "O()" gives an idea of how complex the alogrithm is with 
// respect to the input size

// A typical algorithm with O(n^2) would be the selection sort algorithm
// Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that iterates thru the list to ensure
// every element at index i is the ith smallest/largest element of the list
